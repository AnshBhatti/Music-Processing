# Music-Processing
Involves genre classification, tempo estimation/onset detection, pitch detection, and dynamics detection. Work in progress.

Genre classification:
- Classification of audio files (wav) to 10 genres: blues, classical, country, pop, rock, reggae, hiphop, disco, jazz, and metal

Tempo estimation and onset detection:
- Extracting a tempo value (in beats per minute) from given audio files (wav)

Pitch detection:
- Estimate the pitch of a given audio file (wav)

Dynamics detection:
- Estimate the average time of change in loudness in a given audio file (wav)

# Program
Dependencies
- Librosa
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- ffmpeg (needs to be installed separately and the ffmpeg.exe needs to be added to the environment variables. https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Updates
- Recently started, the research is ongoing and so is model development
